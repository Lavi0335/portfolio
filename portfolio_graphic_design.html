        <h4>Dragel with a Bagel Icon - created using Adobe Illustrator</h4>
        <p>For this project, the objective was to create a set of avatar icons to be used for mobile, tablet and desktop with the level of detail increasing at each point. My set of icon consisted of a small dragon playing along with bagels, since it felt like a cute and fun character to have as an avatar for their profile.</p>

        <h4>Poppin' Cakes - Contact Us Page - Created using Adobe XD and Adobe Illustrator</h4>
        <p>Poppin' Cakes was a brand created as a mock client to do branding and design. Through it, I wanted to make a design that tailored to the brand's personality (which was cake pops that had a flavor for each mood), and pushed to the colours to fill that mood of elegant and quality treats, but with a bit of playfulness in terms of font.</p>

        <h4>Media Arts- Students in The Arts Presentation - Created with Adobe XD</h4> 
        <p>Through a collaboration with a few of my former classmates showcasing the different study fields, I took the lead with designing templates to boost our presentation. Since we use tech for rendering and bringing our projects to life, fonts that took an approach to a modern theme, and vibrant colours captured that theme best. It caught the attention of the younger students we where presenting to, while staying playful.</p>

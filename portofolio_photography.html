        <h4>Light trail - Captured with a Canon 7D Mark |</h4>
        <p>>The Light Trail marks a start in a series of photos that I took, seeking to capture light and it's display from the various technologies surrounding us, but with a twist. Taking advantage of low shutter speeds, and directions I could move my mouse while in low lights, I wanted to see what shapes I could create. This shot ended up being a fairly simple concept, but the movement and gentil fade, it caught my eye.</p>

        <h4>Illumination - Captured with A Canon 7D Mark |</h4>
        <p>Illumination was probably my most satisfying, yet trickiest shot of the series. The lights kept flickering on and off from my computer, and I needed to get very close, while maintain some structure, given the purposeful underexposure. I took about 50 and only 2 turned out well, but with both the framing, and the lack of clarity, it's a composition that really makes you think about what the subject it.</p>

        <h4>Reflection of Lights - Capture with A Canon 7D Mark</h4> 
        <p>An experimental shot that ended up making the cut. What really drew me in was the nice smooth surface of the guitar and reflection of the light forming different shapes. The shot itself also contrasts many of the other pieces with the warm tones of the surrounding area, and clarity. I feel it helps balance out, and adds a hint of surprise to the shots.</p>

        <h4>Lone Starfish Homepage - HTML and CSS code</h4>
        <p>My first coding assignment that I had to create from complete scratch, and honestly it taught me a lot for both CSS, HTML and how much there was to learn and specify for attributes, with raw code. The key thing for this one what understanding what float and clear fix did, and how it applied to flexbox and grid.</p>

        <h4>Three star media website - HTML and CSS Code</h4>
        <p>Following the end of my first term, I was tasked with coding a second mock-up from scratch. This time, I had knowledge on more properties such as flexbox, grids and media queries. The goal was to make the site look as identical to the mock up as possible within the set time frame. Truly utilising the placement of elements with grid and responsive image sizing where key elements in this project.</p>

        <h4>Poppin' Cakes  3 page site - HTML AND CSS</h4> 
        <p>>An experimental shot that ended up making the cut. What really drew me in was the nice smooth surface of the guitar and reflection of the light forming different shapes. The shot itself also contrasts many of the other pieces with the warm tones of the surrounding area, and clarity. I feel it helps balance out, and adds a hint of surprise to the shots.</p>

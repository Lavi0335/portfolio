        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>My name's Lauren Lavictoire, and I'm an ambitious graphic designer who believes that all ideas can be expressed in a visual form.</p>
        <p>I seek to learn and envision astounding projects, and with some hard work and collaboration, we can make it a reality!</p>

        <p>I'm currently an Interactive Media Design student at Algonquin college. With a background in arts, and a passion for teaching myself different skills, having fun in the creative process feels almost like second nature to me! I've done a bit of graphic work and commissions on the side, but I never imagined I could pursue career in the study until I took a risk by entering this program last minute! </p>
        <p>I seek to grow my skills in coding and design, so I can pursue a career in those fields. I want to bring life to media, and be able to have it so that not only I can enjoy what I create, but whoever my target market or audience may be as well. </p>

        <p>Through my journey, I've gotten to work with many clients, co-workers and friends alike. They all have taught me many things and helped me expand my skills. As I progress, be sure to come and see, as my skill set and project scale increases.</p>
